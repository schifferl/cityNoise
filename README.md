# cityNoise
Analysis of noise pollution data across 3 US cities

## Introduction
I have not revisited this project in some time and it may need some tweaks to produce the maps but the fundamental idea of analyzing a large volume of data is still there.

## Data Sources
Data are retrieved from open data portals of Baltimore, MD; New York, NY; and San Fransisco, CA. The links for the portals are shown below. The csv files represent 311 calls, which are then subset to include only noise complaints.

Baltimore, MD = https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/xviu-ezkt/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

New York, NY = https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/erm2-nwe9/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

San Fransisco, CA = https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/vw6y-z8j6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD
